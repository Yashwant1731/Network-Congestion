# Network-Congestion
Predictive analysis of congestion type in a network
The given problem is balanced multiclass classifiaction problem in which we have to predict the network congestion based on the given features.
The determination of network congestion was done on the basis of the bytes used, usage time and network parameters.
The determination was done by the using of various Machine Learning algorithms, Data Visualization and Feature Engineering.
